  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This e-portfolio documents my learning journey throughout the Security and Risk Management module. 
      It contains artefacts, reflections, and evidence of collaboration from each stage of the module, 
      highlighting how I applied theoretical knowledge in a practical context through the secure web app 
      development project. The portfolio is divided into sections covering artefacts, individual contributions, 
      evaluation, and a final reflective essay of 1,000 words.
    </p>

  <section id="artefacts">
    <h2>Section 2: Artefacts and Evidence</h2>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 1–2: Security Risk Analysis</h3>
      <p>Initial threat modeling diagrams identifying potential vulnerabilities and countermeasures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 3–4: Coding Snippets</h3>
      <p>Sample code implementing AES encryption for user password storage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 5–6: Team Discussions</h3>
      <p>Meeting notes and risk mitigation strategies documented in our GitHub Wiki.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 7–8: Peer Feedback</h3>
      <p>Feedback on code quality and testing, implemented in later iterations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 9–10: Testing Results</h3>
      <p>OWASP ZAP penetration testing summary showing improved resilience to XSS and SQL injection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="artefact">
      <h3>Unit 11: Final Project Summary</h3>
      <p>Completed secure web app with user authentication and input validation layers.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="contributions">
    <h2>Section 3: Individual Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      My primary responsibilities included implementing user authentication using salted hash encryption 
      and managing the team’s risk log. I also led the integration of OWASP ZAP testing and ensured compliance 
      with ISO/IEC 27005 standards. Through these contributions, I gained practical insight into applying 
      risk management frameworks to real-world web applications.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="evaluation">
    <h2>Section 4: Evaluation – Final Project vs. Status Document</h2>
    <p>
      Comparing the final project to the Unit 6 status document, the scope was refined to focus on authentication 
      and access control. This change improved project manageability and depth of implementation. The team’s 
      collaboration matured significantly, with better task division and adherence to security protocols.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="reflection">
    <h2>Section 5: Reflective Section</h2>
    <h3>A. WHAT</h3>
    <p>
      The project involved developing a secure web application emphasizing user authentication, encryption, 
      and risk assessment. As part of the team, I contributed to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities 
      in early design stages and implementing secure coding practices.
    </p>

    <h3>B. SO WHAT</h3>
    <p>
      Working in a collaborative environment enhanced my understanding of risk management as per ISO 27005. 
      Applying Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle (1984), I moved from conceptual understanding to active experimentation 
      by implementing and testing security mechanisms. The iterative feedback improved both technical proficiency 
      and team communication following Tuckman’s stages of team development (1965).
    </p>

    <h3>C. NOW WHAT</h3>
    <p>
      This experience reinforced my commitment to pursuing cybersecurity roles. I plan to further develop 
      my expertise in threat modeling, ethical hacking, and risk governance. Integrating reflective practice 
      into future projects will help sustain continuous professional growth.
